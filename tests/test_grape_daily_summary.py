"""The trailing summary of `grape daily`.

Regression cover for a NameError that referenced a `status` dict no scope
had held since the hs_uploader switch. It fired only on the SUCCESS path,
after every stage had completed and state was saved, so the pipeline did
all its work and then died reporting on it: 30 consecutive days of
systemd-visible failure, and -- because the catch-up sweep runs after this
point -- a recovery mechanism that never executed once.
