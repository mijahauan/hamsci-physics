"""The deploy manifest is a cross-repo contract; pin what must not drift.

Two things here are load-bearing beyond this repo:

* the GRAPE upload pipeline's ``source_id`` and transport ``name`` are the
  hs-uploader watermark keys for a KEEP-retention spool.  If they change,
  the daemon re-scans /var/lib/timestd/upload and re-ships every OBS*
  dataset already delivered to PSWS.
* ``grape-daily`` keeps its unit name across the split (operator runbooks),
  while the service units take the hamsci-physics- prefix.
