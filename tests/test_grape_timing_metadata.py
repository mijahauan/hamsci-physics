"""The GRAPE product must carry the timing authority it was recorded under.

Every minute of every decimated product shipped `uncertainty_ms = 999.9`,
`quality_grade = "X"`, `d_clock_ms = 0.0` — verified across all 1440
minutes of AC0G-B4 20260814.  Not staleness: a field-name mismatch.

`decimation_pipeline` read `meta.get('uncertainty_ms', 999.9)` and
`meta.get('quality_grade', 'X')` from the raw chunk sidecar, but
`binary_archive_writer` has never written those keys.  It writes a
`timing` block: `offset_ns`, `offset_sigma_ns`, `judge_tier`.  So the
defaults won every time, for every tier, and the science product was
disconnected from the timing chain entirely — including from the fusion
calibration, which had real ~0.5 ms uncertainties all along.

With T6 authoritative the sidecar now carries offset_sigma_ns = 982496
(0.98 ms), which is grade A on the L2 ladder (A <2 ms, B <4, C <8, D
otherwise).  Shipping "X" for that is throwing away the answer.

This maps forward only.  Products already written are not rewritten.
