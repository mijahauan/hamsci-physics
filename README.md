# hamsci-physics

Ionospheric science products derived from HF time-standard observations —
the science half of the 2026-08-24 `hf-timestd` split.

`hf-timestd` keeps the real-time timing core: RTP→UTC sample labelling, the
broadcast fusion that produces `D_clock`, and the chrony feed. Everything
that turns those labelled observations into *ionospheric* products lives
here:

| Product | Module | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| L3 TEC / dTEC fusion | `physics_fusion_service` | `hamsci-physics-fusion.service` (held — see below) |
| Daily reanalysis of arrivals | `ionospheric_reanalysis` | `hamsci-physics-reanalysis.timer` |
| Travelling ionospheric disturbances | `tid_detector` | (in-process, fusion) |
| Per-path propagation statistics | `propagation_stats` | (in-process, reanalysis) |
| GRAPE / PSWS daily datasets | `grape/` | `grape-daily.timer` |
| IONEX / IRI / space-weather inputs | `cddis`, `scripts/` | `hamsci-physics-ionex-download.timer`, `…-iri-update.timer` |

## Where the boundary is

Three rules define the split, and the test suite pins all three:

1. **hamsci-physics never imports `hf_timestd`** (`tests/test_import_lint.py`).
   Shared engines — TEC solvers, propagation models, the ionosphere stack,
   the io/schema data layer — come from
   [`hamsci-dsp`](https://github.com/HamSCI/hamsci-dsp), which both repos
   depend on.
2. **The data root does not move.** `/var/lib/timestd` is a frozen contract:
   this client reads the timing core's products *in place* (`raw_buffer/`,
   `phase2/`) and writes its own under `phase2/fusion`, `phase2/science` and
   `upload/`. Only the *config* moved, to `/etc/hamsci-physics/config.toml`.
3. **The GRAPE upload pipeline moved verbatim.** Its `source_id`
   (`grape-datasets:/var/lib/timestd/upload`) and transport name are
   hs-uploader watermark keys over a keep-retention spool; changing them
   would re-ship every dataset PSWS already has
   (`tests/test_deploy_contract.py`).

## Install

Through sigmond, like any other client:

```bash
smd install hamsci-physics
smd config init hamsci-physics     # fills [station] from the station identity
smd start hamsci-physics
```

`deploy.toml` is the manifest sigmond reads. hf-timestd must be installed on
the same host — it produces what this client consumes.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest tests/            # ~210 tests
```

`hamsci-dsp` and `hs-uploader` are editable siblings (`[tool.uv.sources]`),
so a `git pull` of either propagates without a reinstall.

## Contract surface

```bash
hamsci-physics version --json
hamsci-physics inventory --json    # what this client is and writes
hamsci-physics validate --json     # exit 1 on any fail-severity issue
hamsci-physics grape daily         # decimate → spectrogram → package → upload
```

## Status

All three products are live. The L3 fusion service runs continuously —
on AC0G/B4 it writes about 14 carrier-phase dTEC records a minute, plus
differential dTEC across WWV, WWVH and BPM, anchored to GNSS VTEC.

One known wart, inherited from the HDF5→SQLite migration: the service's
upstream-freshness check and channel discovery still read the old
file-tree layout. Neither gates the science (the freshness result is
advisory — the loop continues either way), but a permanently "stale"
health signal is a metric that lies, so both are being moved to DB reads.
