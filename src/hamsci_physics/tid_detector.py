TID Detector - Cross-Path Correlation for Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance Detection

================================================================================
DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) are wave-like perturbations in the
ionosphere that propagate horizontally at speeds of 50-300 m/s (medium-scale)
or 300-1000 m/s (large-scale). They cause systematic timing variations that
appear as correlated fluctuations across different propagation paths.

DETECTION PRINCIPLE:
-------------------
1. Each HF path (receiver → station) samples the ionosphere at different points
2. A TID passing through creates timing perturbations that:
   - Appear at different times on different paths (phase delay)
   - Have similar amplitude and period on all paths
   - Show consistent propagation direction

3. Cross-correlation of timing residuals reveals:
   - TID presence (high correlation at non-zero lag)
   - TID velocity (from lag and path geometry)
   - TID direction (from which path leads/lags)

IMPLEMENTATION:
--------------
- Maintain rolling buffers of timing residuals per path
- Band-pass the residuals to the TID period band (≈10-90 min) so diurnal /
  instrumental drift below the band and measurement noise above it cannot
  masquerade as a disturbance
- Compute a per-lag Pearson cross-correlation between path pairs, excluding
  samples interpolated across long data gaps
- Accept a detection only when the best correlation is statistically
  significant after correcting for the number of path pairs searched
- Estimate TID parameters from correlation structure

STATISTICAL SOUNDNESS (code review P-H30..P-H33, 2026-05):
- P-H30: MSTID/LSTID band-pass before cross-correlation; the dominant period
  must fall inside the TID band for a detection.
- P-H31: ``_cross_correlate`` is a true correlation coefficient — Pearson r on
  the per-lag overlap, not ``np.correlate``/N which is biased low at large lag.
- P-H32: a detection must clear a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold
  (the "max correlation over all path pairs" search inflates the best value on
  pure noise) and a minimum-amplitude gate.
- P-H33: samples interpolated across data gaps longer than ``max_gap_minutes``
  are masked and excluded from correlation, so ``np.interp`` cannot fabricate
  smooth low-frequency features across multi-hour HF dropouts.
