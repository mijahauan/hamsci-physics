"""Sigmond client-contract surface (CLIENT-CONTRACT.md v0.8).

Modelled on meteor-scatter's and psk-recorder's ``contract.py`` — the
normal-client reference implementations — rather than hf-timestd's,
which is the atypical case: hf-timestd is the timing-authority
*producer* and assembles its inventory inline.

hamsci-physics is a **meta-client** (§16.3.1): its data plane is files
another sigmond-managed client has already spooled to disk.  hf-timestd
records the IQ and writes the L1/L2 products; this client reads them and
produces ionospheric science.  Three consequences the contract spells
out:

* ``data_path.kind`` is ``"file"`` with ``details.upstream_client``,
  not ``"other"`` — the presence of ``upstream_client`` is exactly how
  sigmond distinguishes a meta-client from replay/archive data.
* the radiod-side fields (``radiod_id``, ``data_destination``,
  ``chain_delay_ns_applied``) MUST be omitted (§16.5).  They are not
  unknown, they are *somewhere else*: on hf-timestd's inventory, where
  the radiod relationship actually exists.  Reporting them here would
  duplicate a fact that can then drift.
* §2, §6, §7 and §8 do not apply.
