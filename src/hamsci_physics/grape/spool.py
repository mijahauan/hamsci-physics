"""Retention for the GRAPE upload spool.

``hs-uploader.service`` ships from ``/var/lib/timestd/upload`` with
``retention = "keep"`` -- it never deletes what it sends.  Until
2026-08-26 grape-daily deleted each package itself, immediately after its
own in-process upload.  Removing that second upload path (so the daemon is
the single outbound route for every client) left the spool with no janitor
at all, and it grows ~40 MB/day.

**Age alone is not a safe rule.**  GRAPE uploads were dead from 2026-08-24
to 2026-08-26 while every status surface reported green; had the outage run
past the retention window, an age-only trim would have quietly deleted
science that was never delivered.  "Old" and "delivered" are different
questions and this module insists on both: a package is removed only when
it is older than the window AND the uploader's watermark cursor has
advanced past it.  Anything old-but-undelivered is KEPT and reported --
that is the alarm, not a nuisance.

Reading the cursor
------------------
The cursor is hs_uploader's KEEP cursor: ``st_mtime_ns`` of the newest OBS
dataset the transport has acked, in ``watermarks(source_id, dest_id,
table_name, cursor)``.

We read it with a **read-only** sqlite connection rather than through
``SqliteWatermarkStore``, deliberately.  That class writes on construct
(schema init, a group-write chmod), and its own docstring says
cross-process writers to one watermark db are "an operator config error".
grape-daily is a different process under a different user; it has no
business opening the daemon's cursor store for writing.  A read-only URI
cannot lock, write, or corrupt it.

The cost is a coupling to hs_uploader's schema.  That is bounded by
failing *safe*: any problem reading the cursor yields ``None``, which
means nothing is provably shipped, which means nothing is deleted.
