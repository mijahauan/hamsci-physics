"""GRAPE → PSWS upload via the shared ``hs_uploader`` library.

This is the cutover from the bespoke ``SFTPUpload`` + ``queue.json``
path (``hamsci_physics.grape.uploader``) to ``hs_uploader``'s
``PswsDatasetSftp`` transport — the single PSWS wire-protocol code path
shared with mag-recorder and future instruments.

Each GRAPE daily dataset is an ``OBS<date>T00-00/`` Digital RF
*directory* tree.  ``PswsDatasetSftp`` uploads it recursively
(``mkdir``/``put`` walk) and then ``mkdir``'s the Grape trigger
directory so the PSWS server ingests it.  Retry + cursor state lives in
``/var/lib/hs-uploader/watermarks.db`` (the suite-wide watermark store),
replacing the per-instrument ``queue.json``.

Datasets are KEPT on disk after upload (matching
``[uploader.sftp].delete_after_upload = false``); the FileTreeSource
runs in ``keep`` retention and tracks shipped datasets by mtime cursor,
so they are not re-uploaded.

Why no post-upload verify: the original ``SFTPUpload.verify()`` re-``ls``'d
the trigger directory, but the PSWS server *consumes* that directory on
ingest — so the check produced false "Verification failed" negatives
even when the data landed.  A zero ``sftp`` return code is the success
signal here (same contract as the magnetometer path).
